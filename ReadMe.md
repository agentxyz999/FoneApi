To run this project, you will need the npm

> npm install
> npm start
> then go to localhost:8004

Functionalities...

1. This simple chatapp is based from the one that I made previously
2. When a user visits the localhost:8004, the user will need to provide a username via alert box
3. Then the user will now be able to send a message.
4. The user will also be able to see the connected user. (There is bug at the moment that the previous connect user are not show)
